## What have been completed?
1. Conv1D, Conv2D, Conv3D, RNN, LSTM, GRU, ConvLSTM2D, CuDNNLSTM, CuDNNGRU, MaxPool1D, MaxPool2D, MaxPool3D, Dropout, AveragePooling1D, AveragePooling2D, AveragePooling3D, ReLU, LeakyReLU, Softmax, Activation, Input, Output, Reshape, RepeatVector, Dense, Flatten, and Embedding layers can be used to create any deep learning model.
2. Arguments of all of the above mentioned layers can be changed, and set.
3. Any image folder can be loaded and converted to tfrecord which can be saved at given path.
4. Any image tfrecord file can be read.
5. Model can be trained, and evaluated.
6. Loss function, optimizer, and learning rate can easily be changed, and set.
7. Generated code from the GUI can be edited, and trained.
8. CSV files can be loaded from the given path.
9. Live update of training's and validation's accuracy and loss can be seen.
